How it works:
- The script is just checking specific pixels on your screen.
  -> This prevents that the script need to inject anything into the client!
  
- When running the script, u need to hover your mouse over the left bottom healthbar and press space to confirm.
- Then you have to press ESC to fetch to pixel color if u press esc (because its a different color!).

- Now if your health drops, the pixel color will change and the script will logout.




Warning!
- The script is very inconsistent and unstable because it's just for learning how to handle with pixels and stuff :)
